# Quest - Summon Your Circle

A cryptic summoning app that orchestrates spontaneous IRL gatherings through mysterious, collaborative quests.

## What is Quest?

Quest transforms ordinary meetups into magical experiences. Instead of "let's get tacos at midnight," your friends receive cryptic fragments:
- "BRING THE CRIMSON ESSENCE" (hot sauce)
- "BRING THE SHELLS" (taco shells)
- "BRING THE HEAT" (meat)

Messages gradually reveal as the convergence time approaches. Everyone arrives with their piece, discovering how it all fits together.

## Demo Flow

1. **Create a Summoning**: Choose your quest type and set the convergence
2. **Fragments Disperse**: Each participant receives a different cryptic instruction
3. **Progressive Reveal**: Details unlock as time/location approaches
4. **Convergence**: Everyone arrives with their piece for the shared experience

## Current Quest Types
- ðŸŒ® MIDNIGHT FEAST (late night tacos)
- ðŸ¥£ CAULDRON RITUAL (soup gathering)
- ðŸ’« MOVEMENT CEREMONY (dance party)
- ðŸ”® UNKNOWN PURPOSE (mystery event)
